# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine weather paterns as they relate to temperature and percipitation in Oahu. Our findings will help us determine if it is viable to start a surf/ice cream shop in the area. 

## Results
* The biggest difference in temperature came in the form of the minimum temperatures
  * June minimum : 64 degrees
  * December minimum : 56 degrees

* There was a slight difference in the average temperatures
  * June average : 75 degrees
  * December average: 71 degrees

* There weren't as many data points for December as there were for June
  * June data points : 1,700
  * December data points: 1,517

## Summary
The request to gather data from these two particular months was to paint a broader picture of what the weather might be like year round, even as you enter the colder winter months. Given that the average temperature was still 71 degrees in December, it is perfectly reasonable to assume a surf/ice cream shop could be successful year round. An additional query that might give us some more helpful information would be to look at the humidity during these months. Humidity can affect how people percieve temperature, and you would want to make sure this isn't something that would make your area less desireable or harder to operate in. Another query you might want to look more in depth at would be the average temperatures during your hours of operation. It is unlikely customers would be visiting your shop between say 7pm and 11am. Therefore, the temperature you really care about is only during the hours of 11am to 7pm, not the full day.
